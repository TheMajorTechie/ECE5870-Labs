1. What gain parameters did you end up using for your PI controller?
â€¢ Describe the response of the system to speed changes

The gain parameters that I used were 5 for Ki and 7 for Kp. The response of the system to speed changes using these values was that the speed was able to change very rapidly with minimal overshooting or ripple effects.
